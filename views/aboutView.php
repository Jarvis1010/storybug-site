            <p>Growing up, my family went camping every summer with my cousins. It was a time we looked forward to every year and it's a tradition I have started with my own family.</p>
            <p>No matter what we did during the day, the climax of every night was always the activities we did at the campfire.  We did skits, told ghost stories, sang songs, and played games.  One of my favorite games was always the story game.  One person starts and then the next person picks up where the last one left off and before long the story has made so many twists and turns that it makes no sense.  It's amazing how much fun it can be to create stories this way.</p>
            <p>That's what this site is all about.  I want to recreate that exact fun we had as a family in a social app style.  Check back often to see how it is getting on.</p>

            <p>My Name is Justin Travis Mair. I have been coding for the past 4 years.  I started this path in 2012 when I decided that we needed more functionality at work in our excel spread sheets.  I chose then to learn VBA for excel.  Eventually, it became one of the primary parts of my job.  I developed excel addins, class modules, and funcitons to speed up my teams ability to do work and I loved every moment of it.  Finding solutions to problems, using code is exhilerating!</p>
            <p>I have decided coding is what I want to do! The best way to learn to do anything is to do it! And that is what this website's purpose is: To learn to code better!</p>
